# 🎧 Mood Coach  
**Your AI companion for emotional well-being.**

Mood Coach is a lightweight, intelligent web app that helps users reflect on their current mood through the context of their favorite music. It generates **positive affirmations**, **emotional reflections**, or **mental health tips** using advanced AI models.

---

## 💡 Concept & Objective

This project is built as part of the **MoodScale Software Developer Internship assignment**. The aim is to blend **music**, **mood**, and **mental health** in a unique and meaningful way using AI.

Mood Coach uses your:
- 🌟 **Current Mood** (e.g., happy, anxious, calm)
- 🎵 **Favorite Song** (title or lyrics)

...to generate supportive and uplifting messages.  
It is powered by **Groq's ultra-fast LLaMA 3 model**, providing real-time emotional feedback to support your mental well-being.

## 🛠️ Setup & Run Instructions

Follow these simple steps to get the app running:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zubair-ahmad-beigh/mood-coach-app.git
cd mood-coach-app

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# For Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# For Mac/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Create a .env file and add your Groq API key
echo GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here > .env

# 5. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
⚠️ Note: .env is already listed in .gitignore, so your API key will stay secure and not be pushed to GitHub.

🔍 How It Works
You select a mood and type in a favorite song.

Choose a message type: Affirmation, Reflection, or Mental Health Tip

The app dynamically creates a prompt using your inputs.

The prompt is sent to Groq’s LLaMA3 model.

You instantly receive a thoughtful response in the Streamlit UI.

🔐 Security Best Practices
✅ .env is listed in .gitignore and not committed
✅ API key is securely loaded using os.getenv()
✅ No keys or secrets are exposed in the codebase
